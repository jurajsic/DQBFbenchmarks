Benchmarks created by running HQSpre (version used in HQS downloaded from https://abs.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/src/projects_view.php?projectID=21 at 18-03-2021, with the same options as used in DQBDD v1.2) on original benchmarks.
See 'results/benchmark-hqspre.2021-03-31_0736.logfiles.zip', these were unzipped into this directory, divided into benchmark sets and for each benchmark set
./cleanresults.sh -p DIRNAME > DIRNAME.set
was run, which created proper DQDIMACS files (and left only those, which were not solved by HQSpre) and a task set file DIRNAME.set, which contains paths to original DQDIMACS files (only those which were not solved by HQSpre).

The benchmark sets are these:
PEC1 - DQBFs  resulting  from  equivalence  checking  of  incomplete  circuits (Biere benchmarks from original)
PEC2 - DQBFs  resulting  from  equivalence  checking  of  incomplete  circuits (Finkbeiner benchmarks from original)
PEC3 - DQBFs  resulting  from  equivalence  checking  of  incomplete  circuits (Scholl benchmarks from original)
SAT - instances obtained from converting SAT instances into DQBFs that depend only on a logarithmic number of variables (Balabanov benchmarks from original)
CSP - DQBFs  resulting  from  controller synthesis problems (Bloem benchmarks from original)
